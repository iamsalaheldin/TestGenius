// This file was originally used to make Genkit flows discoverable by the
// Genkit CLI tools. Since the core AI flows have been migrated to use the
// Anthropic SDK directly and no longer use ai.defineFlow(), this file
// is likely no longer serving its original Genkit-specific purpose for those flows.
// It can be removed if Genkit tooling is no longer in use for this project.
